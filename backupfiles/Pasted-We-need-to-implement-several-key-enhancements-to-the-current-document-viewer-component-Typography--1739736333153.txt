We need to implement several key enhancements to the current document viewer component:

Typography & Layout


Replace current header with OpenType-enabled Old English font, potentially using font-feature-settings for proper ligatures
Implement proper kerning and tracking for the letterforms to prevent text collision
Scale down the "Biliola Lead" subheader while maintaining proper text hierarchy
Ensure proper vertical rhythm throughout the document


QR Code Integration


Current QR code implementation is non-functional - needs complete refactor
Consider using a library like qrcode.js with error correction level H
Implement proper viewport scaling for QR resolution


Interactive Features


Implement text hover states using CSS custom properties for color transitions
Add word-level event delegation for performance optimization
Create a magnification system using either:

CSS transform scale with proper positioning calculations, or
Canvas-based magnification for better performance with large documents


Target magnification range: 1000-1500% with smooth scaling


Accessibility Enhancements


Implement ARIA 1.2 compliant controls
Add keyboard navigation support
Ensure screen reader compatibility with proper heading structure
Support high contrast mode via prefers-contrast media query


Settings System


Create a context-based settings management system
Implement persistent storage for user preferences
Features to include:
javascriptCopy{
  magnification: {
    enabled: boolean,
    level: number, // 10-15x
    smoothing: boolean
  },
  appearance: {
    theme: string,
    pageColor: string,
    textHighlight: {
      enabled: boolean,
      color: string,
      transition: string
    }
  },
  typography: {
    baseSize: number,
    scaling: number,
    kerning: boolean
  }
}



Performance Considerations


Implement virtual scrolling for large documents
Use CSS containment for better paint performance
Consider using IntersectionObserver for lazy loading of complex text effects
Implement debouncing for magnification calculations

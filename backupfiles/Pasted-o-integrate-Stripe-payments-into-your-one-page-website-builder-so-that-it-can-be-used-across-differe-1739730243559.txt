o integrate Stripe payments into your one-page website builder so that it can be used across different websites while dynamically adjusting to each site's needs, follow these steps:

1. Choose the Right Stripe Integration Approach
Since your goal is to enable payments on multiple websites, you need a flexible, scalable, and embeddable Stripe integration.

Best Options for Your Use Case:
Stripe Elements (Embedded Components)

This gives full control over the payment UI, allowing customization per website.
Works with PaymentIntents API for dynamic payment methods.
Allows collecting customer data, setting up subscriptions, and handling payment flows.
Best for seamless integration into your website builder.
Stripe Checkout (Prebuilt Form - Hosted Page)

Redirects users to a Stripe-hosted checkout page that can be customized.
No coding needed for the UI, but customization is limited.
Good for websites where you want a quick setup without managing payments directly.
Stripe Payment Links (No-Code Option)

If you just want a simple way for users to pay, this method allows you to generate links dynamically for each site.
The easiest way to collect payments without coding.
2. Set Up Your Stripe Account
Go to Stripe Dashboard and create an account.
Activate your account by providing business details and banking information.
3. Implement Stripe on Your Website Builder
Since you're creating a website builder, you need to allow each site you create to dynamically integrate Stripe. Follow these steps:

A. Embed Stripe Elements (Recommended for Customization)
Install Stripe's SDK

Use stripe-js and react-stripe-js (for React) or vanilla JS for a traditional setup.
sh
Copy
Edit
npm install @stripe/stripe-js
Set Up the Payment Form

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { loadStripe } from "@stripe/stripe-js";
import { Elements, CardElement, useStripe, useElements } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";

const stripePromise = loadStripe("your-publishable-key-here");

function CheckoutForm() {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const elements = useElements();

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const { paymentMethod, error } = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({
      type: "card",
      card: elements.getElement(CardElement),
    });

    if (!error) {
      console.log("Payment Successful", paymentMethod);
    } else {
      console.log(error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <CardElement />
      <button type="submit" disabled={!stripe}>Pay</button>
    </form>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </Elements>
  );
}

export default App;
B. Dynamically Set Stripe for Each Website
Each website built with your one-page website builder should store its own Stripe API key in the backend.
You can allow users to input their Stripe API key in your builder‚Äôs settings.
Example: Store each site's Stripe Secret Key in a database and dynamically load it when processing payments.
C. Automate Payment Processing for Different Websites
Use Stripe Connect to let website owners register and accept payments through your platform.
Implement a dashboard for users to manage their Stripe settings.
4. Enable Additional Payment Features
Enable Dynamic Payment Methods:

Automatically display different payment methods based on the customer's region.
Save Customer Payment Details (Link Integration):

Allow returning customers to pay faster with Stripe Link.
Add Subscription Support (Stripe Billing):

If your users want to charge recurring payments, integrate Stripe Billing API.
5. Test and Deploy
Test in Stripe‚Äôs Test Mode before going live.
Monitor transactions via the Stripe Dashboard.
Enable Webhooks for real-time payment status updates.
6. Deploy Across Different Websites
Now, every website built with your one-page website builder will automatically integrate Stripe for payments.
Users can enter their own Stripe credentials or use a shared Stripe account based on your business model.
Next Steps:

Do you want me to generate code for Stripe Connect, so multiple websites can register and get paid?
Would you like a UI for users to enter their Stripe API keys in your builder?

View the Stripe.js reference
Create an Express Checkout Element
This code creates an elements group with an Express Checkout Element and mounts it to the DOM.



const appearance = { /* appearance */ }
const options = { /* options */ }
const elements = stripe.elements({
  mode: 'payment',
  amount: 1099,
  currency: 'usd',
  appearance,
})
const expressCheckoutElement = elements.create('expressCheckout', options)
expressCheckoutElement.mount('#express-checkout-element')
Note
Express Checkout Element dynamically resizes Payment Method buttons to fill available space, but individual buttons can have different minimum widths depending on the Payment Method. Be sure to test at different screen sizes, especially if mounting Express Checkout Element in a narrow container.

Payment methods
The Express Checkout Element presents one-click payment methods that are active, supported, and set up.

Some payment methods require activation in the Dashboard.
Payment methods are only available when the customer uses a supported browser and pays in a supported currency.
Some payment methods require setup actions from the customer. For example, a customer won‚Äôt see a Google Pay button if they don‚Äôt have Google Pay set up.
The element sorts payment methods by relevance to your customer.

To control these behaviors, you can customize the payment methods.

Supported browsers
Certain payment methods work with specific browsers.

Apple Pay	Google Pay	Link	PayPal	Amazon Pay
Chrome1					
Edge					
Firefox					
Opera					
Safari	2				
Chrome on iOS 16+					
Firefox on iOS 16+					
Edge on iOS 16+					
1Other chromium browsers might be supported. For more information, see supported browsers.

2When using an iframe, its origin must match the top-level origin (except for Safari 17+ when specifying allow="payment" attribute). Two pages have the same origin if the protocol, host (full domain name), and port (if specified) are the same for both pages.

Layout
By default, when the Express Checkout Element displays multiple buttons, it arranges the buttons in a grid based on available space, and shows an overflow menu if necessary.

You can override this default and specify a grid layout yourself with the layout option.

Text
You can control a button‚Äôs text by selecting a buttonType. Each wallet offers its own types.


Link

Apple Pay

Google Pay

PayPal

Amazon Pay
Link only offers one button type, which presents the ‚ÄúPay with Link‚Äù call to action and the Link logo.

We attempt to detect your customer‚Äôs locale and use it to localize the button text. You can also specify a locale.

This example code includes the call to action ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù or ‚ÄúBuy now‚Äù for buttons that support it. Then, it specifies the locale de to get their German equivalents.



const expressCheckoutOptions = {
  buttonType: {
    applePay: 'buy',
    googlePay: 'buy',
    paypal: 'buynow',
    klarna: 'pay',
  }
}
const elements = stripe.elements({
  locale: 'de',
See all 19 lines
Appearance
You can‚Äôt fully customize the appearance of Express Checkout Element buttons because each payment method sets its own logo and brand colors. You can customize the following options:

Button height
Border radius using variables with the Appearance API
Button themes
Note
The Apple Pay button automatically resizes when border radius increases beyond a certain threshold. If modifying the default border radius, make sure to test it with all active payment methods.

This example code sets up an elements group with a light theme and 36px border radius, makes buttons 50px tall, and overrides the theme to use the white-outline version of the Apple Pay button.



const appearance = {
  theme: 'stripe',
  variables: {
    borderRadius: '36px',
  }
}
const expressCheckoutOptions = {
  buttonHeight: 50,
  buttonTheme: {
See all 23 lines
We support the following themes:


Link

PayPal

Apple Pay

Google Pay

Amazon Pay
Link has a single button theme, which is readable on either a light or a dark background.

Customize payment methods
You can‚Äôt specify which payment methods to display. For example, you can‚Äôt force a Google Pay button to appear if your customer‚Äôs device doesn‚Äôt support Google Pay.

But you can customize payment method behavior in various ways, such as:

You can activate or deactivate payment methods from the Dashboard.
You can override Stripe‚Äôs default logic of sorting payment methods by relevance. Use the paymentMethodOrder option to set your preferred order.
If there is too little room in the layout, low-relevance payment methods might appear in an overflow menu. Customize when the menu appears using the layout option.
To prevent Apple Pay or Google Pay from appearing, set paymentMethods.applePay or paymentMethods.googlePay to never.
To allow Apple Pay or Google Pay to appear when they‚Äôre not set up, set paymentMethods.applePay or paymentMethods.googlePay to always. This still won‚Äôt force them to appear on unsupported platforms, or when the payment is in an unsupported currency.
Regional considerations
Finland
Sweden
Regulations in Finland and Sweden require you to present debit payment methods first before showing credit payment methods at checkout in these countries.

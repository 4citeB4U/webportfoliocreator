OK, go ahead take a screenshot. As you can see, the preview pops up as a 404. And this is the response that you get after asking the AIA question. Go ahead and take a screenshot and read the council.

The preview shows a 404 error when loading pages
The AI Assistant is giving errors when asked questions

You're absolutely right. I apologize for the confusion. Let me fix the AI integration to use Ollama instead of OpenAI. I'll update both the server and client code to properly integrate with Ollama.

AI
I see that Ollama is not running or accessible on port 11434. Let me first check if we need to install Ollama system-wide, and then help set up the proper integration.

2 hours ago

AI
The current approach isn't working because we need clarification on the Ollama setup. There are several options we can pursue:

Configure the application to connect to an existing Ollama instance (if one exists elsewhere)
Set up a different AI provider that's compatible with the current environment
Update the integration code to match your specific Ollama setup
Before proceeding, we need to know:

Is Ollama running somewhere specific we should connect to?
Should we be using a different model or configuration?
Are there specific environment variables we should be using?
You can also use the rollback button in the chat pane to return to a previous working state if needed.

How would you like to proceed?

How to use from the
Transformers
library

Copy

Use a pipeline as a high-level helper
from transformers import pipeline

messages = [
{"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"},
]
pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B")
pipe(messages)

Copy

Load model directly
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B")

Looking at the error you've shown, I can identify the issue. The JSON response shows both project data AND an error, which indicates we have a syntax error in our storage.ts file - specifically a missing comma after the preview object's closing brace.

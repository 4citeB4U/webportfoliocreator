Two plus two.

Four.

Give me the square root of 38 plus the math that it takes to get from Milwaukee to Chicago in three hours.

The square root of 38 is approximately 6.16.

To cover the distance between Milwaukee and Chicago (about 92 miles) in three hours, you'd need to maintain an average speed. Here's the math:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 92 miles / 3 hours â‰ˆ 30.67 miles per hour.

OK, quick question. When it comes to Cody, especially when dealing with website creation and. react components. I'm having issue with putting my. doing a copy paste drop more so of a grab and drop so that I can pull up a preview screen but I'm having an issue putting that in. How would I go by that?

To implement a drag-and-drop feature in a React application to display a preview screen, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the State:** Create state variables to manage the file being dragged and the preview URL.

   ```jsx
   const [file, setFile] = useState(null);
   const [preview, setPreview] = useState(null);
   ```

2. **Handle Drag-and-Drop Events:** Implement event handlers for drag-and-drop functionality.

   ```jsx
   const onDrop = (event) => {
     event.preventDefault();
     const droppedFile = event.dataTransfer.files[0];
     setFile(droppedFile);

     if (droppedFile) {
       const previewUrl = URL.createObjectURL(droppedFile);
       setPreview(previewUrl);
     }
   };

   const onDragOver = (event) => {
     event.preventDefault();
   };
   ```

3. **Create the Drag-and-Drop Area:** Set up a simple component with a div to handle file drops.

   ```jsx
   return (
     <div
       onDrop={onDrop}
       onDragOver={onDragOver}
       style={{ width: '300px', height: '200px', border: '2px dashed #000' }}
     >
       {preview ? (
         <img src={preview} alt="Preview" style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }} />
       ) : (
         <p>Drag and drop a file here</p>
       )}
     </div>
   );
   ```

4. **Clean Up Resources:** Optionally, use an effect to clean up the object URL when the component unmounts or the file changes.

   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     return () => {
       if (preview) {
         URL.revokeObjectURL(preview);
       }
     };
   }, [preview]);
   ```

This setup allows you to drag and drop files into the specified area, automatically updating and displaying a preview. Make sure your application supports the file types you intend to preview.

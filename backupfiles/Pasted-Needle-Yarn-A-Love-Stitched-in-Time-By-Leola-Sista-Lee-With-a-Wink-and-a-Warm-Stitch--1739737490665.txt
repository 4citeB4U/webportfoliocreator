Prologue: A Stitch in Time

"Gather 'round, my dears, and let Sista Lee spin you a tale. Not just any tale, mind you, but a love story woven with the very threads of creation. Imagine a world where the tools of our craft aren't just inanimate objects, but living, breathing beings with hearts that yearn, dreams that soar, and stories that whisper of connection and belonging.

This, my friends, is the story of Needle and Yarn. He, a seasoned hook with a past as rich as the finest tapestry. She, a vibrant ball of cotton, brimming with the potential of a thousand dreams. Their love, as you'll soon discover, is a testament to the enduring power of connection, the beauty of imperfection, and the magic that happens when two souls find their perfect stitch.

But it's not just their story. It's a story of friendship, of community, of the joy of creating something beautiful from the simplest of beginnings. It's a story about overcoming challenges, embracing change, and finding your place in the world, one loop, one stitch, one heartfelt moment at a time.

And as you journey with Needle and Yarn, you'll not only learn the secrets of crochet, passed down through generations, but you'll also discover the profound truth that lies at the heart of every handmade creation: that love, like a well-crafted stitch, can hold the world together.

So, settle in, get cozy, and let your heart be your guide. Let's unravel this tale together, and perhaps, along the way, you'll find a little bit of your own story woven within its threads."

(Page 3)

A Tangled Beginning (and a Slip Knot)

The old sewing basket wasn't just a container; it was a microcosm of life, a bustling community nestled within its woven walls. For Needle, it was everything. He was a distinguished aluminum crochet hook, his silver surface no longer pristine, but etched with the marks of countless projects, each a testament to his skill and dedication. He carried the weight of experience, the memory of hands both young and old, the echoes of laughter and whispered secrets.

He'd been the trusted companion of Elara, a woman whose hands moved with the grace of a dancer, transforming yarn into works of art. He remembered the warmth of her lap, the scent of lavender and wool, the feeling of being essential. After Elara, there had been others, fleeting encounters that left him feeling‚Ä¶ incomplete. He longed for a connection that ran deeper, a partnership that resonated with his soul.

Then, she arrived.

"Oh, my stars! I seem to have gotten myself into a bit of a‚Ä¶ well, a right proper mess!"

The voice was bright, effervescent, a splash of sunshine in the quiet hum of the basket. Needle, startled from his melancholic musings, looked up. It was Yarn, a glorious, tangled explosion of sunset orange cotton. She was a whirlwind of color and energy, a vibrant contrast to the more subdued tones of the other inhabitants.

"Well, aren't you a breath of fresh air?" Needle chuckled, a warmth spreading through his metal core. He felt an immediate pull, an undeniable attraction to this chaotic, beautiful creature.

"I'm Yarn," she announced, her voice a delightful mix of embarrassment and excitement. "And I seem to have lost my way a bit."

"I'm Needle," he replied, his voice a low, comforting rumble, the hint of a Southern drawl a legacy of his time with Elara. "And I believe I can help you with that."

The other residents of the basket watched with amusement and curiosity. Scissors, a sharp-tongued but loyal friend to Needle, snickered, "Looks like you've met your match, old friend." He and Needle shared a bond forged through countless projects, a camaraderie built on mutual respect and a shared understanding of the craft.

Thimble, a wise and gentle soul, her silver cap gleaming, offered Yarn a reassuring smile. "Don't you worry, dear. Needle's the best there is at untangling knots." She and Yarn would soon develop a close friendship, sharing stories and offering each other support.

Measuring Tape, ever practical and precise, stretched himself out, assessing the situation. "Hmm, quite a tangle indeed. But nothing Needle can't handle." He admired Needle's skill and often sought his advice on matters of structure and design.

(Instructional Interlude on Page 5)
(Page 4)
As Needle gently began to work on Yarn's tangles, he felt a sense of purpose he hadn't realized he'd been missing. This wasn't just about untangling yarn; it was about connecting with another being, sharing his knowledge, and embarking on a new adventure.

"You see, Yarn," he explained, his voice taking on a gentle, instructive tone, "every creation, like every meaningful relationship, begins with a simple connection. A foundation."

He knew this was the perfect moment to introduce her to the basics of crochet, to share the legacy that had been passed down to him. It was also a chance to get to know this captivating creature, to understand her dreams and aspirations.

Before they could begin their crafting journey, however, there was one more member of their community to introduce: their human companion, Leola.

The sewing basket sat on a small, round table in a sun-drenched corner of Leola's living room. Her home was a reflection of her spirit ‚Äì warm, inviting, and filled with handmade treasures. Colorful crocheted afghans draped over the furniture, intricate doilies adorned the tables, and whimsical amigurumi creatures peeked out from shelves. Plants thrived in macram√© hangers, their leaves reaching towards the sunlight that streamed through the lace-curtained windows. The air hummed with the gentle rhythm of Leola's life ‚Äì the soft strains of jazz music, the comforting aroma of simmering spices from the kitchen, the occasional laughter of grandchildren visiting their beloved "Grandma Lee."

Leola was a middle-aged African American woman, her stature petite but her presence grand. Her hands, weathered by time but still strong and nimble, were the instruments of her creativity. She had a kind smile, eyes that sparkled with warmth and wisdom, and a gentle touch that could calm the most frayed of nerves (or yarns!). She'd discovered the joy of crochet as a young girl, learning from her own grandmother, and it had been her solace, her passion, her creative outlet ever since.

She'd found Needle, Yarn, Scissors, Thimble, and Measuring Tape at a local fabric and craft swap meet, a gathering of artisans and enthusiasts sharing their treasures and their love for the handmade. Leola had been drawn to them instantly, sensing their history, their potential, their yearning for a new purpose. She knew, with a certainty that only a true crafter can understand, that they were meant to be a part of her world.

Instructional Interlude: The Slip Knot and Chain Stitch

(This section is formatted with clear, bullet-point instructions and illustrations, mimicking a textbook style.)

Holding the Hook and Yarn:

Needle's Guidance: "Hold me like you'd hold a delicate flower," Needle instructed, "firmly enough to guide, but gently enough to allow for movement. Or, perhaps, like you're about to conduct a symphony of stitches."

Illustration: A hand holding a crochet hook in a pencil grip, and another in an overhand (knife) grip. Arrows showing comfortable finger placement. Close-ups showing the details.

Yarn's Perspective: "And me? Imagine I'm a silken river, flowing through your fingers. I need a gentle tension, a guiding hand, but don't constrict me. Let me breathe, let me express myself."

Illustration: A hand holding yarn, with the yarn flowing over the index finger, under the middle finger, and over the ring and pinky fingers. Arrows showing the yarn path. Different hand positions illustrated.

Making a Slip Knot:

Needle's Wisdom: "This, my dear Yarn, is our first embrace. The knot that binds us, the foundation upon which we'll build a tapestry of dreams."

Instruction: "Wrap the yarn around your index and middle fingers, forming a loop. Imagine you're creating a circle of hope, a promise of what's to come."

Illustration: Hand with yarn looped around fingers.

Instruction: "Insert your hook (that's me!) into the loop, as if you're stepping into a world of endless possibilities."

Illustration: Hook inserted into the loop.

Instruction: "Catch the working yarn (the strand connected to the ball) with your hook, like you're reaching out to take my hand."

Illustration: Hook catching the yarn.

Instruction: "Pull the working yarn through the loop on your hook, drawing us closer, weaving our destinies together."

Illustration: Yarn being pulled through, forming the knot.

Instruction: "Tighten gently. Not too much, or you'll stifle the connection. Just enough to make it secure, a bond that will withstand the test of time."

Illustration: Completed slip knot on the hook.

Sista Lee's Tip: "Don't you worry if it takes a few tries, sugar. Even the greatest love stories have a few awkward beginnings! It's all about finding your rhythm, your connection."

(Page 6)

The Chain Stitch (ch):

Needle's Encouragement: "Now, we build. Each chain is a step forward, a link in our journey, a shared breath, a whispered promise."

Instruction: "Yarn over (wrap the yarn around the hook from back to front), like you're giving me a warm, comforting embrace."

Illustration: Hook with yarn wrapped around it (yarn over). Arrow showing direction.

Instruction: "Draw the yarn through the loop already on your hook, creating a connection, a bond, a link in the chain of our love."

Illustration: Hook pulling the yarn through the loop.

Instruction: "That's one chain stitch! See? You're creating something beautiful, something real, something that connects us."

Illustration: A single chain stitch.

Instruction: "Keep doing that ‚Äì yarn over, pull through ‚Äì until you have a chain as long as your heart desires, a testament to the infinite possibilities that lie before us."

Illustration: A longer chain of stitches.

Yarn's Joy: "It's like holding hands, Needle! Each stitch a promise, a step forward, a shared moment, a whispered secret."

Sista Lee's Tip: "Keep your chains even, like a steady heartbeat. Not too tight, not too loose. Find your flow, your inner rhythm, the music of your soul."

(Troubleshooting Tips in Side Boxes):

Slip Knot Too Tight? Gently pull on the yarn tail to loosen it.

Slip Knot Unraveling? Pull on the working yarn to tighten it.

Chains Uneven? Focus on maintaining consistent tension.

Chain Twisted? Make sure your hook goes under the yarn when you yarn over.

Lost Count? Use stitch markers every 10 or 20 chains.

(Page 7)

The First Dance - A Scarf of Whispers (and the Rhythm of Single Crochet)

With the basics mastered, Yarn was brimming with excitement. "Needle," she exclaimed, her fibers practically dancing, "I want to create! I want to make something beautiful, something that expresses the joy I feel!"

Needle, his heart swelling with affection, felt a surge of inspiration. "A scarf, my dear Yarn," he suggested, "is the perfect first project. It's like a flowing ribbon, a whisper of color, a dance of stitches."

He remembered Elara's first project ‚Äì a simple garter stitch scarf in a soft, blue yarn. It hadn't been perfect, but it had been made with love, and that's what mattered. He wanted Yarn to experience that same sense of accomplishment, that same joy of creation.

"A scarf?" Yarn pondered, her fibers swirling thoughtfully. "But what will it say? What story will it tell?"

"It will tell your story, Yarn," Needle replied gently. "It will be a reflection of your spirit, your dreams, your vibrant energy."

He knew that Yarn longed to dance, to express herself through movement. He imagined the scarf flowing around her as she twirled and leaped, a tangible representation of her inner grace and beauty.

Scissors, who had been listening intently, chimed in, "And it'll keep you from catching a chill, Yarn! Practicality and beauty, that's the ticket!" He and Needle often bantered like this, their contrasting personalities creating a playful dynamic. Needle appreciated Scissors's directness and his unwavering support, even if it sometimes came with a sharp edge.

"Scissors is right," Needle agreed. "A scarf can be both beautiful and functional. And it's the perfect way to learn the single crochet stitch, the foundation of so many wonderful creations."

Yarn, her initial hesitation replaced with renewed enthusiasm, eagerly agreed. "Let's do it, Needle! Let's create a scarf of whispers, a dance of stitches!"

(Instructional Transition)

"Alright, my dear Yarn," Needle said, his voice taking on a gentle, instructive tone. "Let's begin our dance. Let me guide you through the steps of the single crochet."

(Page 8)
(Continued Story and Instruction)
As they worked, selecting a soft, variegated yarn that echoed Yarn‚Äôs vibrant personality. The chosen colors were shades of deep reds, soft pinks, and warm oranges.
Needle explained each step with patience and clarity. He showed her how to insert the hook, how to yarn over, how to pull the yarn through, creating each stitch with a deliberate and graceful motion. He emphasized the importance of consistent tension, of finding the rhythm that would make the scarf flow and drape beautifully.

Yarn, initially clumsy, began to find her own rhythm. Her fibers, at first hesitant, started to move with a newfound confidence. She listened intently to Needle's instructions, absorbing his knowledge, feeling the connection between them deepen with each completed stitch.

She also found herself drawn to the conversations between Needle and Scissors. They'd reminisce about past projects, debate the merits of different techniques, and tease each other mercilessly. She learned that Scissors, despite his sharp exterior, had a deep respect for Needle's skill and a genuine affection for him. They were like an old married couple, their bickering a sign of their enduring bond.

"Remember that time you tried to crochet with that awful, scratchy burlap yarn?" Scissors cackled, his blades glinting. "You nearly bent yourself in half!"

Needle chuckled, "And you, my friend, almost snipped off Elara's finger when she was trying to weave in the ends!"

Yarn giggled, enjoying their playful banter. She realized that the craft basket wasn't just a collection of tools; it was a family, bound together by shared experiences, mutual respect, and a love for creation.

As the scarf grew longer, Yarn began to share her own dreams and aspirations. She spoke of her longing to dance, to express the joy and energy that surged within her. She confessed her insecurities, her fear of not being "good enough," of not fitting in with the other, more neatly wound yarns.

Needle listened patiently, offering words of encouragement and reassurance. "You are perfect just the way you are, Yarn," he said softly. "Your vibrancy, your energy, your 'messiness' ‚Äì that's what makes you unique, that's what makes you beautiful."

He realized he was falling in love with her, not just for her beauty, but for her spirit, her resilience, her unwavering enthusiasm. He saw in her a reflection of his own longing for connection, for purpose, for a love that transcended the ordinary.

Instructional Interlude: Single Crochet and Scarf Basics

(Clear, bullet-point instructions with illustrations, textbook style.)

The Single Crochet (sc):

Instruction: "Insert your hook into the next stitch (or chain, if you're working the first row), like you're gently exploring new territory."

Illustration: Hook inserted into a stitch.

Instruction: "Yarn over (wrap the yarn around the hook from back to front), like you're reaching out to embrace the yarn."

Illustration: Hook with yarn over.

Instruction: "Draw the yarn through the stitch, creating a new loop on your hook. You should now have two loops on your hook."

Illustration: Hook pulling yarn through, two loops on hook.

Instruction: "Yarn over again, like you're preparing for a final, graceful movement."

Illustration: Hook with yarn over again.

Instruction: "Draw the yarn through both loops on your hook, completing the single crochet stitch. You've created a connection, a bond, a single, beautiful step."

Illustration: Hook pulling yarn through both loops, completed sc stitch.

Sista Lee's Tip: "Don't pull your yarn too tight, honey! Let it breathe, let it flow. You want your stitches to be relaxed and happy, just like you!"

Maintaining Tension:

Needle's Advice: "Tension is the key to creating even, consistent stitches. It's like finding the perfect balance in a dance ‚Äì not too rigid, not too loose, just right."

Illustration: Examples of too-tight tension (fabric puckering), too-loose tension (fabric loose and uneven), and just-right tension (fabric smooth and even).

Creating Straight Edges:

Scissors's Tip: "Keep those edges straight, like you're walking a tightrope! No wobbling, no wandering. Precision is key!"

Instruction: "At the end of each row, chain 1 (this is your turning chain and doesn't count as a stitch). This gives you the height you need for the next row."

Illustration: Chain 1 at the end of a row, work turned.

Instruction: "Work your first single crochet of the new row into the first stitch of the previous row (under both loops of the 'v' shape)."

Illustration: Hook inserted into the correct stitch.

Sista Lee's Tip: "Count your stitches at the end of each row! It's like making sure all your dance partners are present and accounted for."

(Continuation of Scarf Project and Story)
(Return to Story)

As Yarn continued to practice the single crochet, she began to feel a sense of accomplishment, a growing confidence in her abilities. The scarf, once a daunting challenge, was now taking shape, a tangible representation of her progress and her partnership with Needle.

"Look, Needle!" she exclaimed, holding up her work. "It's‚Ä¶ it's actually starting to look like a scarf!"

Needle smiled, his heart filled with pride. "It is, Yarn. And it's beautiful, just like you."

He noticed the way the variegated yarn created subtle shifts in color, the way the stitches formed a gentle, rhythmic pattern. It was a reflection of Yarn's personality ‚Äì vibrant, dynamic, and full of surprises.

As they neared the end of the scarf, Yarn began to talk about her dreams of dancing. She imagined herself twirling and leaping, the scarf flowing around her like a ribbon of light, a testament to her freedom and her joy.

"I want to dance for everyone, Needle," she said, her voice filled with passion. "I want to share my joy, my energy, my love with the world."

Needle, deeply moved by her words, knew that he wanted to be a part of that dream. He wanted to support her, to encourage her, to help her create a life filled with beauty and purpose. He realized that his love for her was more than just affection; it was a deep and abiding commitment to her happiness and well-being.

When the scarf was finally finished, Yarn wrapped it around herself and began to dance. The craft basket, usually a scene of quiet industry, was transformed into a stage. The tools watched in awe as Yarn moved with a grace and fluidity that belied her earlier clumsiness. The scarf, a testament to their shared creation, flowed around her like a whisper of color, accentuating her every movement.

Needle felt a lump in his throat, his heart overflowing with love. He'd never seen anything so beautiful. He knew that this was just the beginning of their journey together, a journey filled with endless possibilities, with challenges and triumphs, with love and laughter.

Threads Entwined - A Hat of Hopes (and the Warmth of Half Double Crochet)

The air in Leola's home grew crisp, carrying the scent of autumn leaves and pumpkin spice. The change in season brought a new wave of inspiration to the craft basket.

"Oh, Needle," Yarn said, shivering slightly, "I feel a bit of a chill. I wish I had something to keep my‚Ä¶ my top‚Ä¶ warm."

Needle, ever attentive to Yarn's needs, immediately knew what to suggest. "A hat, my dear Yarn," he said. "A hat is like a warm embrace, a cozy hug for your head."

He remembered the countless hats Elara had created, each one a labor of love, designed to protect and comfort. He recalled the feeling of satisfaction he'd experienced as he helped shape those hats, knowing that they would bring warmth and joy to their recipients.

"A hat?" Yarn considered, her fibers swirling thoughtfully. "But wouldn't that be‚Ä¶ difficult?"

"Not at all, my dear," Needle reassured her. "We'll learn a new stitch, the half double crochet. It's a bit taller than the single crochet, creating a denser, warmer fabric. Perfect for keeping you snug and cozy."

Thimble, who had been quietly listening, chimed in, "And it's a very versatile stitch, Yarn. You can use it to create all sorts of wonderful things." She and Yarn had developed a close bond, often sharing quiet conversations and offering each other encouragement. Thimble, with her years of experience, was a source of wisdom and comfort for Yarn, who was still relatively new to the world of crafting.

"I've seen Leola use the half double crochet to make the most beautiful sweaters and blankets," Thimble continued. "It creates a lovely texture, soft and comforting."

Yarn, reassured by Thimble's words and Needle's unwavering support, agreed to try. "Alright, Needle," she said. "Let's make a hat! A hat of hopes, a crown of warmth!"

(Instructional Transition)

"Excellent, my dear Yarn," Needle said, his voice filled with enthusiasm. "Let's begin our ascent to the top of hat-making! Let me introduce you to the magnificent half double crochet."

(Page 12)
(Continued Story)

As Needle explained the new stitch, he found himself reflecting on the many hands he'd known, the many projects he'd helped create. He remembered the young girl who'd struggled to master the half double crochet, her brow furrowed in concentration, her tongue sticking out in determination. He remembered the busy mother who'd used the stitch to create a quick and cozy scarf for her child. He remembered the college student who'd experimented with different colors and textures, creating a unique and stylish hat for a friend.

Each crafter had left their mark on Needle, their energy and their stories woven into the very fabric of his being. He realized that he wasn't just a tool; he was a keeper of memories, a conduit for creativity, a link between generations of makers.

He looked at Yarn, her fibers glowing with anticipation, and felt a surge of love and gratitude. He was grateful for her presence in his life, for her unwavering enthusiasm, for her willingness to learn and grow. He knew that their journey together would be filled with challenges, but he also knew that they would face them together, with love, patience, and a shared commitment to creating something beautiful.

Instructional Interlude: Half Double Crochet and Hat Construction

(Clear, bullet-point instructions with illustrations, textbook style.)

The Half Double Crochet (hdc):

Instruction: "Yarn over (wrap the yarn around your hook from back to front), like you're preparing for a slightly grander gesture than the single crochet."

Illustration: Hook with yarn over.

Instruction: "Insert your hook into the next stitch (or chain), like you're venturing into slightly deeper waters."

Illustration: Hook inserted into a stitch.

Instruction: "Yarn over again, like you're gathering your resources for the next step."

Illustration: Hook with yarn over again.

Instruction: "Draw the yarn through the stitch, creating a new loop on your hook. You should now have three loops on your hook."

Illustration: Hook pulling yarn through, three loops on hook.

Instruction: "Yarn over one final time, like you're summoning all your strength for the final push."

Illustration: Hook with yarn over again.

Instruction: "Draw the yarn through all three loops on your hook, completing the half double crochet stitch. You've created a stitch that's both sturdy and elegant."

Illustration: Hook pulling yarn through all three loops, completed hdc stitch.

Sista Lee's Tip: "The half double crochet is like a warm embrace ‚Äì taller than a single crochet, but not as imposing as a double crochet. It's just right for creating cozy hats and all sorts of comforting creations!"

Making a Beanie (Basic Pattern):

Start with a Magic Ring (or alternative):

Magic Ring:

Wrap yarn around your fingers, crossing over to form a loop.

Insert hook into the loop, yarn over, and pull through a loop.

Chain 1 (this doesn't count as a stitch).

Illustration: Magic ring formation.

Alternative: Chain 2, then work the required number of stitches into the second chain from the hook.

Illustration: Alternative method.

Round 1:

Instruction: Work 6 single crochet (sc) stitches into the magic ring (or the second chain from the hook).

Illustration: 6 sc in the ring.

Needles advice: Remember to keep track, Yarn.

(Page 14)
(Continuation of Hat Instructions)

Round 2 (Increasing):

Instruction: Work 2 half double crochet (hdc) in each stitch around (12 stitches total).

Illustration: 2 hdc in each stitch.

Round 3 (Increasing):

Instruction: *1 hdc in the next stitch, 2 hdc in the next stitch*. Repeat from * to * around (18 stitches total).

Illustration: Pattern of 1 hdc, 2 hdc.

Round 4 (Increasing):

Instruction: *1 hdc in each of the next 2 stitches, 2 hdc in the next stitch*. Repeat from * to * around (24 stitches total).

Illustration: Pattern of 1 hdc, 1 hdc, 2 hdc.

Continue Increasing:

Instruction: Continue increasing in this pattern, adding one more hdc between the increases in each round. For example:

Round 5: *1 hdc in each of the next 3 stitches, 2 hdc in the next stitch* (30 stitches)

Round 6: *1 hdc in each of the next 4 stitches, 2 hdc in the next stitch* (36 stitches)

And so on...

Sista Lee's Tip: "Use a stitch marker to mark the beginning of each round. It'll help you keep track of your progress, like a little beacon guiding you through the stitches!"

Work Even:

Instruction: Once the circle is the desired diameter for the crown of the hat (measure against your head or use a size chart), stop increasing. Work 1 hdc in each stitch around for several rounds until the hat reaches the desired length.

Optional Ribbed Brim:

Instruction: To create a ribbed brim, work in rows instead of rounds. Chain the desired width of the brim (e.g., 6-8 chains).

Instruction: Single crochet in the back loops only (BLO) of each stitch across the row.

Instruction: Chain 1, turn, and repeat, working in the BLO of each stitch.

Instruction: Continue until the brim is long enough to fit around the bottom edge of the hat.

Instruction: Sew the brim to the hat.

Fasten Off and Weave in Ends:

Instruction: Cut the yarn, leaving a tail. Yarn over and pull through the last loop on your hook. Weave in the ends with a yarn needle.

(Page 15)

A Stitch in Time Saves Nine (Needle's Journey)

The hat was nearing completion, a testament to Yarn's growing skill and Needle's patient guidance. They were working in perfect harmony, their movements synchronized, their spirits intertwined.

Suddenly, disaster struck.

As Needle was guiding Yarn through a particularly tricky increase, he felt a sharp, searing pain. He cried out, a sound unlike anything Yarn had ever heard from him.

"Needle! What's wrong?" Yarn exclaimed, her fibers trembling with fear.

Needle, his voice strained, replied, "I‚Ä¶ I think I've chipped my tip. On that‚Ä¶ that knot!" He'd snagged on a particularly stubborn knot in the yarn, a consequence of Yarn's earlier, less-experienced technique.

The other tools rushed to his side, their concern evident in their expressions. Scissors, his blades usually poised for action, hung limp. Thimble, her normally cheerful demeanor replaced with worry, gently touched Needle's side. Measuring Tape, his usually precise measurements forgotten, stretched himself out in a gesture of comfort.

"Oh, Needle! You poor thing!" Thimble exclaimed.

"We need to get you to Leola," Scissors said, his voice unusually subdued. "She'll know what to do."

Leola, alerted by the commotion, carefully picked up Needle, her fingers gentle and reassuring. She examined his chipped tip with a practiced eye, her expression a mixture of concern and determination.

"Don't you worry, my little friend," she murmured. "We'll get you fixed up."

She carefully placed Needle in a small, padded case, the same case she used to transport her most precious tools. Yarn watched, her fibers twisted with anxiety, as Leola prepared to leave.

"Where are you taking him?" Yarn asked, her voice trembling.

"To the repair station, dear," Leola replied. "It's like a hospital for tools. They'll take good care of him."

The repair station. The words filled Yarn with dread. She'd heard whispers of the place, a mysterious

### **Let's Fix This QR Code & Preview Issue Once and for All**
Your issue seems to be a combination of **incorrect URL routing**, **QR code generation errors**, and **preview display issues**. I‚Äôll walk through a **step-by-step debugging process** to pinpoint and solve this issue permanently.

---

## **üîç Step 1: Verify the Correct Project URLs**
Before we do anything, confirm the **exact URLs** where both projects should be accessible:

1. **Leola‚Äôs Digital Library**
   - Expected URL: `https://your-domain.com/projects/leolas-library`
   - Current URL when scanning QR: **Does it match this exactly?**
   - If different, what URL does it redirect to?

2. **Pro Driver Academy**
   - Expected URL: `https://your-domain.com/projects/pro-driver-academy`
   - Current URL when scanning QR: **Does it match this exactly?**
   - If different, what URL does it redirect to?

‚ö° **Test:** Try **manually** entering the expected URLs in your browser. Do they work as expected? If not, we need to check the routing.

## **üîç Step 2: Check Routing & Deployment on Replit**
The previews and QR codes may not work because your deployment isn't correctly handling routes.

### **‚úÖ Check if the App is Deployed & Running**
1. Open **Replit logs** (console).
2. Run:
   ```sh
   npm run build && npm start
   ```
   If any errors appear, **screenshot or paste them here**.

3. Check your **Replit deployment settings**:
   - Is it deployed as a **static site** or a **Node.js app**?
   - Are the routes in **Replit settings** correctly mapping to `/projects/leolas-library` and `/projects/pro-driver-academy`?

---

## **üîç Step 3: Fix the QR Code Generation**
It looks like the QR codes may be **incorrectly linking to the home page** instead of specific project pages.

### **‚úÖ Check the QR Code Generator Code**
1. Open **`ShowcasePage.tsx` (or wherever the QR codes are generated)**.
2. Look for the function generating the URLs, it should look something like:
   ```tsx
   const projectUrl = `${window.location.origin}/projects/${projectSlug}`;
   const qrCodeUrl = `https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=150x150&data=${encodeURIComponent(projectUrl)}`;
   ```
3. **Fix any issues:** If `window.location.origin` is incorrect, manually define the full URL:
   ```tsx
   const projectUrl = `https://your-domain.com/projects/${projectSlug}`;
   ```
4. If the QR codes are still pointing to `/` (home page), ensure `projectSlug` is correctly set for each project.

## **üîç Step 4: Fix the Website Previews**
It sounds like the **previews are not loading the full website**, and instead just showing text content.

### **‚úÖ Check the `iframe` in `ShowcasePage.tsx`**
1. Open `ShowcasePage.tsx` and look for the `<iframe>` preview section.
2. It should use **`src` with the correct URL**, e.g.:
   ```tsx
   <iframe src={`https://your-domain.com/projects/${projectSlug}`} width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
   ```
3. **Common Issues:**
   - If `src` is missing, the preview won‚Äôt load.
   - If **CORS errors** appear, the domain may need to allow embedding (`X-Frame-Options` should not be `deny`).

---

## **üîç Step 5: Verify Web Speech API is Working**
Now, let‚Äôs fix **the text-to-speech issue**.

### **‚úÖ Check Console Errors for Web Speech API**
1. Open **Developer Tools (`F12`) > Console**.
2. Look for any **red errors** related to `speechSynthesis` or `Web Speech API`.
3. If there are errors like **‚Äúspeech synthesis not supported‚Äù**, the browser might be blocking it.

### **‚úÖ Fix Web Speech API in `VoiceSelector.tsx`**
Modify the function handling speech:
```tsx
if ('speechSynthesis' in window) {
   const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Hello, welcome to Leola‚Äôs Digital Library!");
   speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
} else {
   console.error("Web Speech API is not supported in this browser.");
}
```
- **If blocked** by **autoplay policies**, ensure the speech is triggered by **user interaction** (e.g., clicking a button).

---

## **üöÄ Next Steps**
1. **Manually visit the expected URLs** and confirm they are working.
2. **Check the console logs on Replit** for errors.
3. **Inspect `ShowcasePage.tsx`** for incorrect `iframe` and QR code generation.
4. **Fix Web Speech API** errors by debugging `speechSynthesis`.

Once you‚Äôve done these checks, let me know what results you‚Äôre seeing! If you can send **error logs or updated QR code links**, I can diagnose further. üöÄ

I'm sorry to hear you're encountering difficulties with your current setup, particularly the 404 errors when attempting to view your project within the editor. Let's address these issues systematically and provide advanced code examples to enhance your tool development toolkit.

**1. Resolving the 404 Error:**

The 404 "Page Not Found" error often arises due to misconfigurations in your development environment, especially when integrating tools like Vite and Express.js. Here's how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

- **Check Project Naming Conventions:**

  Ensure that your project directory names do not contain spaces or special characters. Vite, in particular, has been known to encounter issues when project names include spaces, leading to 404 errors. For instance, a project folder named `My Project` may cause problems, whereas renaming it to `MyProject` or `My_Project` can resolve these issues. citeturn0search2

- **Verify Vite Configuration:**

  Inspect your `vite.config.js` file to ensure that the `base` property is correctly set. An incorrect base path can lead to assets not being found, resulting in 404 errors. Here's an example configuration:

  ```javascript
  // vite.config.js
  export default {
    base: './', // Ensure this matches your deployment context
    // other configurations
  };
  ```

  Adjust the `base` property to match the root of your project or the specific subdirectory if your project is hosted within one.

- **Ensure Proper Routing in Express.js:**

  Your Express.js server should correctly serve the static files generated by Vite. Here's an example of how to set this up:

  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const path = require('path');
  const app = express();

  // Serve static files from the Vite build directory
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));

  // Handle all other routes by serving the index.html file
  app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'));
  });

  const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
  ```

  This setup ensures that all routes are handled appropriately, preventing 404 errors when navigating within your application.

**2. Enhancing the Editor with Advanced Features:**

To provide a more sophisticated editing experience, consider integrating the following tools:

- **CodeMirror for In-Browser Code Editing:**

  [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) is a versatile JavaScript-based code editor that can be embedded directly into your web application. It offers features like syntax highlighting, bracket matching, and code folding. Here's how you can integrate CodeMirror:

  1. **Include CodeMirror Assets:**

     Add the necessary CSS and JS files to your project:

     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://codemirror.net/lib/codemirror.css">
     <script src="https://codemirror.net/lib/codemirror.js"></script>
     ```

  2. **Initialize CodeMirror on a Textarea:**

     Transform a `<textarea>` into a CodeMirror editor:

     ```html
     <textarea id="code-editor"></textarea>
     <script>
       const editor = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(document.getElementById('code-editor'), {
         lineNumbers: true,
         mode: 'javascript', // Set the language mode as needed
         theme: 'default',   // You can choose different themes
       });
     </script>
     ```

     This setup provides a robust in-browser code editing experience.

- **Live Preview with Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR):**

  Vite's HMR allows for instantaneous updates to your application without a full reload, which is essential for a seamless editing experience. Ensure that your development server is properly configured to support HMR:

  ```javascript
  // main.js
  if (import.meta.hot) {
    import.meta.hot.accept((newModule) => {
      // Handle the updated module
    });
  }
  ```

  This configuration enables live previews of changes made within the editor.

**3. Implementing Drag-and-Drop Functionality:**

To facilitate the import of project files into your editor, implement a drag-and-drop interface:

- **HTML Structure:**

  ```html
  <div id="drop-zone">Drop your project files here</div>
  ```

- **JavaScript Handling:**

  ```javascript
  const dropZone = document.getElementById('drop-zone');

  dropZone.addEventListener('dragover', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    dropZone.classList.add('drag-over');
  });

  dropZone.addEventListener('dragleave', () => {
    dropZone.classList.remove('drag-over');
  });

  dropZone.addEventListener('drop', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    dropZone.classList.remove('drag-over');
    const files = event.dataTransfer.files;
    // Process the files as needed
  });
  ```

  This script enables users to drag and drop files into the editor, enhancing usability.

**4. Deploying Updates to the Live Site:**

After editing, automate the deployment of updates to your live site:

- **Build the Project:**

  Use Vite's build command to generate production-ready assets:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Deploy Assets to the Server:**

  Transfer the contents of the `dist` directory to your server's public directory. This can be automated using deployment scripts or tools like [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) or [FTP](https://filezilla-project.org/).

- **Restart the Server:**

  After deployment, ensure your Express.js server reloads to serve the new content. Tools like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) can

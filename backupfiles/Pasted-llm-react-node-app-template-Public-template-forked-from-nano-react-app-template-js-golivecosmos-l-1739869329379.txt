LLM React App Javascript Template ü™ê
License Cosmos Cosmos

What is this template?
This template is an example project for a simple Large Language Model (LLM) application built on top of React and Node. This template was built on top of the React template app from nano-react-app and updated with a Node server that uses HuggingFace.js and LangChain.js to connect to supported large language models. Use this template to easily build and run an LLM app, like the screenshot below:

Getting Started
To get started, follow the below steps:

Create an .env file by copying the SAMPLE_env file and add the model store provider you'll be using (e.g. HUGGING_FACE or OPEN_AI) and the API keys for the models you are going to use

Install packages

Run the backend server that will start with a default port of 3100

    yarn start-server
Run the frontend server that will start with a default port of 5173.

   yarn start
Note: You can use the -p flag to specify a port for the frontend server. To do this, you can either run yarn start with an additional flag, like so:

    yarn start -- --port 3000
Or, edit the start script directly:

vite --port 3000
Additional scripts are provided to prepare the app for production

yarn build ‚Äî This will output a production build of the frontend app in the dist directory.
yarn preview ‚Äî This will run the production build of the frontend app locally with a default port of 5173 (note: this will not work if you haven't generated the production build yet).
